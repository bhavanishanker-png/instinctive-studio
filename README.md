```

3. **Run the application locally:**

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start and listen on a port (usually `http://localhost:3000` by default).

4. **Access the API:**
   - You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to make `GET` and `POST` requests to `http://localhost:3000/api/students`.

## Deployment

The application is hosted on Vercel. You can access the deployed API at the following URL:

```
https://<your-app-name>.vercel.app/api/students
```

## Database

This application uses Prisma ORM for database management. Ensure your database is set up correctly with Prisma migrations. If needed, run the following command to generate the Prisma client after installing dependencies:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```
